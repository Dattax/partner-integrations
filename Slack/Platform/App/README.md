# Slack

This integration is between JFrog Artifactory and Xray and Slack. We know that software development happens in a myriad of tools and collaboration environments. Today there are key events throughout the JFrog Platform that can be difficult for a user to interact with if they aren't logged in. When it comes to people across the organization knowing what’s going on, there aren’t great solutions. This will give each user situational awareness about occurrences in the JFrog Platform.  Additionally, where appropriate - they will have easy links and action buttons to go follow-up on the event.

# How it Works

* This integration allows you the ability to see Artifact, Artifact Properties, Docker, Release Bundle, and Build events through notifications and actionable cards inside the Microsoft Teams browser. 
* Additionally, you can get notification based on policies setup in JFrog Xray.

# Requirements

* You must be a user with Admin permissions to generate a JPD key.
* You must have the ability to setup policies and watches prior to getting Xray notifications.
* You should have a cloud instance of Artifactory. You can signup for a free cloud instance at: https://jfrog.com/start-free/
